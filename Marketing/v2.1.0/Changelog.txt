Enter your measurements to find out clothing sizes for brands worldwide. Want to find out sizes for a T.M. Lewin shirt for work? Buying a dress from DKNY? Shopping for a gift abroad? Going skiing and want to know your boot size?

Manufacturers size clothes differently, so called 'vanity sizing'. Pocketailor converts your measurements to the actual sizes published on the manufacturers websites resulting in fewer returns and less time in the fitting rooms.

Pocketailor also features a simple way to adjust the sizes in case the manufacturer recommended size does not fit. This can be sent back to Pocketailor cloud to improve the conversions next time.
